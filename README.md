## This is the library that contains the macro crate **genapi_macro**

# DEVELOPMENT

In development use it as binary crate (*with main.rs file*)

### Future Tasks:
1. Think about how to set this up as a proper library
2. Consider moving *genapi_macro* to its own repo
3. Write helper functions for specific token parsing
